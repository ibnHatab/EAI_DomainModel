*** Request-Reply
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/RequestReply.html

    - When two applications communicate via Messaging, the
      communication is one-way. The applications may want a two-way
      conversation.

    - When an application sends a message, how can it
      get a response from the receiver?

    - Send a pair of Request-Reply messages, each on its own channel.

    - Request-Reply has two participants

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/RequestReplySpec.scala::class%20RequestReplySpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][RequestReplySpec.scala]]

*** Return Address
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/ReturnAddress.html

    - My application is using Messaging to perform a Request-Reply.

    - How does a replier know where to send the reply?

    - The request message should contain a Return Address that
      indicates where to send the reply message.

    - Server create a child Worker to handle a specific kind of
      complex message, but Worker to reply to the original Client
      sender, not to the parent Server.

#+begin_src plantuml :file img/return_address.png
title ReturnAddress
hide footbox

Client -> Server:  Request(client.pid)
Server -> Worker: forward(Request(client.pid))
...
Worker --> Client: Reply

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:return_address.png]]
    - The request message should contain a Return Address that
      indicates where to send the reply message.

    - This way, the replier does not need to know where to send the
      reply, it can just ask the request.

      ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/ReturnAddressSpec.scala::class%20ReturnAddressSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ReturnAddressSpec.scala]]

*** Envelope Wrapper
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/EnvelopeWrapper.html

    - How can existing systems participate in a messaging exchange
      that places specific requirements on the message format, such as
      message header fields or encryption?

    - Use a Envelope Wrapper to wrap application data inside an
      envelope that is compliant with the messaging
      infrastructure. Unwrap the message when it arrives at the
      destination.

*** Content Enricher
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/DataEnricher.html

    - When sending messages from one system to another it is common
      for the target system to require more information than the
      source system can provide.

    - How do we communicate with another system if the message
      originator does not have all the required data items available?

    - Use a specialized transformer, a Content Enricher, to access an
      external data source in order to augment a message with missing
      information.

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/ContentEnricherSpec.scala::class%20ContentEnricherSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ContentEnricherSpec.scala]]

#+begin_src plantuml :file img/content_enricher_spec.png
title content_enricher_spec
hide footbox
create reception
create SheduledDoctorVisit
reception -> SheduledDoctorVisit: new("Joe")

reception -> SheduledDoctorVisit: CompleteVisit(accountEnricher)
SheduledDoctorVisit -> AccountEnricherDispatcher: DoctorVisitCompleted
AccountEnricherDispatcher -> AccountEnricherDispatcher: query("Joe")
AccountEnricherDispatcher -> AccountSystemDispatcher: forward(DoctorVisitCompleted("Joe, Doe"))
reception <- AccountSystemDispatcher  :DoctorVisitCompleted("Joe, Doe")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

*** ContentFilter
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/ContentFilter.html

    - The Content Enricher helps us in situations where a message
      receiver requires more - or different - data elements than the
      message creator provides.

    - Use a Content Filter to remove unimportant data items from a
      message leaving only important items.

    - Enricher deals with outgoing messages, MessageFilter with incoming

    - [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/ContentFilterSpec.scala::class%20ContentFilterSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ex: ContentFilterSpec.scala]]

*** Splitter
    - How can we process a message if it contains multiple elements,
      each of which may have to be processed in a different way?

    - Use a Splitter to break out the composite message into a series
      of individual messages, each containing data related to one item.

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/SplitterSpec.scala::class%20SplitterSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ContentFilterSpec.scala]]

*** Content-Based Router
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html

    - How do we handle a situation where the implementation of a
      single logical function (e.g., inventory check) is spread across
      multiple physical systems?

    - Use a Content-Based Router to route each message to the correct
      recipient based on message content.

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/ContentBasedRouter.scala::class%20ContentBasedRouter%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ContentBasedRouter.scala]]

*** Dynamic Router
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/DynamicRouter.html

    - How can you avoid the dependency of the router on all possible
      destinations while maintaining its efficiency?

    - Use a Dynamic Router, a Router that can self-configure based on
      special configuration messages from participating destinations.

    - Besides the usual input and output channels the Dynamic Router
      uses an additional control channel. During system start-up, each
      potential recipient sends a special message to the Dynamic
      Router on this control channel, announcing its presence and
      listing the conditions under which it can handle a message. The
      Dynamic Router stores the 'preferences' for each participant in
      a rule base.

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/DynamicRouter.scala::class%20DynamicRouterRouter%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][DynamicRouterRouter.scala]]

*** Routing Slip
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/RoutingTable.html

    - How do we route a message consecutively through a series of
      processing steps when the sequence of steps is not known at
      design-time and may vary for each message?

    - Attach a Routing Slip to each message, specifying the sequence
      of processing steps. Wrap each component with a special message
      router that reads the Routing Slip and routes the message to the
      next component in the list.

    - ec: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/RoutingSlip.scala::class%20RoutingSlipSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][RoutingSlipSpec.scala]]

    - rem: good start for Sequencer

*** Recipient List
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/RecipientList.html
    - How do we route a message to a list of dynamically specified
      recipients?

    - Define a channel for each recipient. Then use a Recipient List
      to inspect an incoming message, determine the list of desired
      recipients, and forward the message to all channels associated
      with the recipients in the list.

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/RecipientListSpec.scala::class%20RecipientListSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][RecipientListSpec.scala]]

*** Aggregat
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/Aggregator.html
    - How do we combine the results of individual, but related
      messages so that they can be processed as a whole?
    - Use a stateful filter, an Aggregator, to collect and store
      individual messages until a complete set of related messages has
      been received. Then, the Aggregator publishes a single message
      distilled from the individual messages.
    - The Aggregator is a special Filter that receives a stream of
      messages and identifies messages that are correlated.
    - termination criteria:
      - Wait for All
      - Timeout
      - First Best
      - Timeout with Override
      - External Event
    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/RecipientListSpec.scala::class%20RecipientListSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][RecipientListSpec.scala]]   + Aggregator

*** Scatter-Gather
    - https://vaughnvernon.co/?p=561
    - How do you maintain the overall message flow when a message
      needs to be sent to multiple recipients, each of which may send
      a reply?
    - Use a Scatter-Gather that broadcasts a message to multiple
      recipients and re-aggregates the responses back into a single
      message.
    - When using Publishes-Subscriber and feeding result to Aggregator
      termination creteria might not terminate (no pun
      intended). There for we must use timeout on 'gather pass.
    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/Scatter-Gather.scala::class%20ScatterGatherSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ScatterGatherSpec.scala]]
*** Resequencer
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/Resequencer.html
    - How can we get a stream of related but out-of-sequence messages
      back into the correct order?
    - Use a stateful filter, a Resequencer, to collect and re-order
      messages so that they can be published to the output channel in
      a specified order.
    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/ResequencerSpec.scala::class%20ResequencerSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ResequencerSpec.scala]]

*** Claim Check
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/StoreInLibrary.html
    - How can we reduce the data volume of message sent across the
      system without sacrificing information content?
    - Store message data in a persistent store and pass a Claim Check
      to subsequent components. These components can use the Claim
      Check to retrieve the stored information.
    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/ClaimCheckSpec.scala::class%20ClaimCheckSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][ClaimCheckSpec.scala]]

*** Message Expiration
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/MessageExpiration.html

    - How can a sender indicate when a message should be considered
      stale and thus shouldn’t be processed?

    - Set the Message Expiration to specify a time limit how long the
      message is viable.

    - Most messaging system implementations reroute expired messages
      to the Dead Letter Channel

    - use System.currentTimeMillis to avoid TZ issue

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/MessageExpirationSpec.scala::class%20MessageExpirationSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][MessageExpirationSpec.scala]]

*** Message Bus
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/MessageBus.html
    - What is an architecture that enables separate applications to
      work together, but in a decoupled fashion such that applications
      can be easily added or removed without affecting the others?

    - Structure the connecting middleware between these applications
      as a Message Bus that enables them to work together using
      messaging.

    - Canonical Data Model that is independent from any specific
      application. Require each application to produce and consume
      messages in this common format.

    - ex: [[file:src/test/scala/patterns/eai/MessageBusSpec.scala::class%20MessageBusSpec%20extends%20TestKit(ActorSystem("EAI"))][MessageBusSpec.scala]]

*** Message Channel
    - http://www.eaipatterns.com/MessageChannel.html
    - How does one application communicate with another using
      messaging?

    - Connect the applications using a Message Channel, where one
      application writes information to the channel and the other one
      reads that information from the channel.

    - Events cannot fail when being replayed to a processor, in
      contrast to commands
